Danger log

1.Carefully handle database error:
  1.1 When insert into database, we may meet some request violates database defination.
      For example, if client try to create two accounts with the same id, postgres will throw
      pqxx::unique_violation, so I will catch this exception and send back error message to client.
  1.2 We set constrains for symbol amount and account balance.
      If client try to send some request to make amount or balance become negative, the database
      will throw pqxx:check_violation. Then we will catch these exception and send error messgae to client.
