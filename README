If you want to test by using our test client and testcases,
 you should:
 cd docker-deploy/src/
 make clean
 make
 then run client as: ./client ipaddress testfile
              like:  ./client 127.0.0.1 ./testing/create.txt

You can check our testcases by looking into docker-deploy/src/testing
We have comments in each testfile
